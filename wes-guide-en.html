<h1>WES ECA for Canada Immigration (2026): Documents, Fees & Timeline</h1>
<p class="guide-intro">
            This guide is for applicants who need a WES Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) for Canada immigration, including 
            Express Entry and Provincial Nominee Programs (PNP).
            We explain evaluation types, required documents, transcript delivery, fees, processing time, and common issues.
          </p>
<hr class="section-divider"/>
<h2>Step 1: Confirm Whether You Need a WES Evaluation and Which Type</h2>
<h3>When is a WES evaluation required?</h3>
<p>The following situations often require or recommend a WES report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applying for Canada immigration (Express Entry / PNP) and needing an ECA;</li>
<li>Applying to universities or colleges in Canada (especially graduate programs);</li>
<li>Employers or licensing bodies need to verify the equivalency of foreign degrees.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main WES evaluation types</h3>
<p>Different programs require different report types. The most common are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course-by-Course Evaluation</strong> – lists each course and credit; often used for admissions.</li>
<li><strong>Document-by-Document Evaluation</strong> – provides an overall degree equivalency; often used for immigration or employment.</li>
</ul>
<p>
            Before placing an order, you should carefully check the requirements of your target schools or institutions,
            or send them to us so that we can help you choose the most suitable evaluation type.
          </p>
<hr class="section-divider"/>
<h2>Step 2: Create a WES Account and Enter Your Education History</h2>
<h3>Create your account and select the country</h3>
<p>
            Go to the WES website, choose the appropriate program and create a personal account.
            Use a long-term, frequently used email address so that you will not miss important notifications.
          </p>
<p>
            When selecting the purpose of the evaluation, you can choose options such as “Education”, “Immigration”
            or “Licensing” according to your situation. Different purposes correspond to different packages and fees.
          </p>
<h3>Add your education history</h3>
<p>Follow the prompts to enter your education details, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Country and city of study;</li>
<li>Name of the institution (using the dropdown list when possible);</li>
<li>Degree obtained, major, and dates of attendance;</li>
<li>Whether you have graduated and obtained the official diploma.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="section-divider"/>
<h2>Step 3: Prepare Personal and Academic Documents</h2>
<h3>Typical documents required</h3>
<p>The exact requirements vary by country and degree level, but usually include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passport bio page or other identity document;</li>
<li>Degree certificate and/or diploma;</li>
<li>Transcripts (in many cases, WES only accepts transcripts sent directly by your institution);</li>
<li>Name change documents if applicable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Language and translation requirements</h3>
<p>
            WES generally requires documents in English. If your original documents are in another language,
            you must provide proper English translations. We can help you with certified translations and formatting
            that follow WES standards.
          </p>
<hr class="section-divider"/>
<h2>Step 4: Arrange for Your Institution to Send Official Transcripts</h2>
<h3>Why must the school send them?</h3>
<p>
            To ensure authenticity, WES normally requires that official transcripts be sealed and sent directly
            by the institution, education authority or archive office. Transcripts mailed by the applicant
            are often not treated as official documents.
          </p>
<h3>Delivery methods and tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>The envelope must be properly sealed and stamped, and show your WES reference number;</li>
<li>Common methods include EMS, DHL, UPS or special channels designated by authorities;</li>
<li>Keep your tracking number and regularly check the “Documents received” status in your WES account.</li>
</ul>
<p>
            If you are overseas or find it difficult to communicate with your institution, you may authorize us
            to help coordinate transcript delivery with the school or archive office.
          </p>
<hr class="section-divider"/>
<h2>Step 5: Submit Your Application Online and Pay the Fees</h2>
<p>
            After confirming all information and understanding the document requirements,
            you can submit the order and pay the evaluation fee in your WES account.
            WES supports multiple payment methods; your bank may charge an additional international transaction fee.
          </p>
<p>
            Once the order is confirmed, WES will generate a detailed “Required Documents” list and your WES reference number.
            This number must be included with all documents sent to WES.
          </p>
<hr class="section-divider"/>
<h2>Step 6: Wait for the Evaluation and Monitor the Status</h2>
<h3>Processing time and report format</h3>
<p>
            After WES has received all required documents, the evaluation usually takes about
            <strong>7–20 business days</strong>. When it is complete, you can download the electronic report
            in your account, and WES may also send paper copies to your chosen recipients.
          </p>
<h3>Common reasons for delays</h3>
<ul>
<li>Slow delivery or loss of mail from the institution;</li>
<li>Inconsistent information between documents, requiring clarification or re-issuance;</li>
<li>Documents not meeting the definition of “official documents” and needing to be resent.</li>
</ul>
<p>
            If your account shows “On Hold” or “Need Additional Information”, check the explanation carefully
            and respond as soon as possible. If you have difficulty doing this on your own,
            our consultants can help review WES messages and suggest solutions.
          </p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>1. Is it enough to evaluate only my highest degree?</h3>
<p>
            Some programs only require the highest degree, while others prefer a complete education history.
            You should always follow the official instructions of your target schools or institutions.
            If you are unsure, you can send us the requirements and we will help interpret them.
          </p>
<h3>2. Can I use transcripts that are already sealed in an envelope?</h3>
<p>
            It depends on who sealed them and how. In some cases WES can accept “official sealed documents”
            forwarded by the applicant, but if the envelope has been opened or the stamp is not valid,
            new documents may be required.
          </p>
<h3>3. Can WES send the report to multiple recipients?</h3>
<p>
            Yes. You can add multiple recipients in your WES account, with additional fees depending on the number.
            You may also purchase additional reports later if you apply to more institutions.
          </p>
<h3>4. What if WES refuses or questions my documents?</h3>
<p>
            First, read the WES explanation carefully to identify whether the problem is with translation,
            format or the institution’s status. If you need assistance, you can share the message and copies
            of your documents with us and we will advise on feasible next steps.
          </p>
