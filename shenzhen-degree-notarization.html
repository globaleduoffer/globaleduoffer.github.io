<h1>How to Notarise a Chinese Degree in Shenzhen</h1>
<div class="guide-meta">Last updated: June 2025 (subject to the latest official requirements)</div>
<p>
          Shenzhen has many universities and international schools. Every year a large number of graduates need to
          use Chinese degree certificates overseas for employment, immigration or further study. For many destinations,
          the first step is to complete <strong>degree notarisation in Shenzhen</strong>, and then proceed with Hague
          apostille or embassy / consular legalization as required by the receiving authority.
        </p>
<p>
          This guide focuses on degree notarisation in Shenzhen itself. For the subsequent apostille or consular
          legalization steps, please refer to our separate guide on degree apostille and consular legalization.
        </p>
<hr class="section-divider"/>
<h2>1. Where can you notarise a degree in Shenzhen?</h2>
<p>
          Shenzhen has several notary offices that are qualified to handle foreign-related cases. In practice,
          different notary offices may focus on different districts or have slightly different document lists.
          It is therefore important to confirm in advance whether the notary office you choose can accept your case.
        </p>
<p>
          Generally speaking, <strong>Shenzhen notary offices only accept degrees issued by universities located
          within Shenzhen</strong>. If your degree was issued in another city or province, you will normally need
          to return to that region for notarisation.
        </p>
<h2>2. What documents are usually required?</h2>
<p>
          The exact requirements may vary between notary offices, but you should be prepared for at least:
        </p>
<ul>
<li>Your original degree certificate and, if applicable, graduation certificate and transcripts;</li>
<li>Your Chinese ID card or passport and copies of the information page;</li>
<li>
            A power of attorney and the agent's ID, if you authorise another person or agency to submit the
            application on your behalf;
          </li>
<li>
            In some cases, an online academic verification report (for example from CHSI) or confirmation from the
            university may be required as additional evidence;
          </li>
<li>Any other documents listed by the notary office in their latest guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
          When you call the notary office, you should explain clearly that the degree will be used abroad and ask
          them to send the latest checklist of required documents, templates and appointment rules.
        </p>
<hr class="section-divider"/>
<h2>3. Typical notarisation process in Shenzhen</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Pre-consultation.</strong> Contact the notary office to confirm whether your degree is within
            their jurisdiction, which documents are needed and whether an appointment is required.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>Prepare documents.</strong> Collect originals and copies according to the checklist and fill out
            the necessary application forms.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>Submit the application.</strong> Go to the notary office (or have your agent go) at the appointed
            time, submit all documents and pay the fees.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>Review and issuance.</strong> The notary office will review your materials and, if everything is in
            order, issue a notarisation document for your degree. In some cases, they may contact the university or
            ask for additional evidence.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>Collect the notarised documents.</strong> Pick up the finished notarisation according to the
            instructions (or authorise an agent to collect it).
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          If the notarised degree will later be used for Hague apostille or consular legalization, it is recommended
          to confirm at the notarisation stage whether translation, multiple originals or additional certified copies
          are needed, so that you can handle everything in one go.
        </p>

<h2>4. Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h2>
<h3>Q1: Can I notarise a non-Shenzhen degree in Shenzhen?</h3>
<p>
          In most situations, no. Shenzhen notary offices usually only have jurisdiction over degrees issued by
          universities located in Shenzhen. If your degree was issued elsewhere, you will generally need to notarise
          it in the region where the university is located.
        </p>
<h3>Q2: Can an agency help me complete the notarisation?</h3>
<p>
          With a proper power of attorney, many notary offices accept applications submitted by professional agencies.
          This can be very helpful if you are overseas or not currently living in Shenzhen. However, you may still
          be required to cooperate with certain identity checks or provide additional documents.
        </p>
<h3>Q3: How should I coordinate degree notarisation with later apostille / legalization?</h3>
<p>
          Different countries and authorities have different requirements. Some accept Hague apostille, others need
          full consular legalization, and some systems (such as certain Chinese work permits) rely on separate academic
          verification channels. It is important to confirm the final requirements first, and then design a combined
          plan for notarisation and authentication.
