<h1>Beijing Police Certificate (PCC) Guide for Foreigners</h1>
<div class="guide-meta">Last updated: June 2025 (subject to the latest official requirements)</div>
<p>
          This guide explains how foreigners who have lived, worked or studied in Beijing can apply
          for a China Police Certificate (PCC) and how to prepare for subsequent use of the certificate
          for immigration, visas, background checks, notarization and legalization.
          In practice, detailed requirements may change over time and may differ slightly by district,
          so you should always follow the most recent notices from the local Public Security Bureau,
          notary offices and consulates.
        </p>
<hr class="section-divider"/>
<h2>Step 1: Apply for a Police Certificate in Beijing</h2>
<h3>Where to apply?</h3>
<p>
          In most cases, applications are handled by the <strong>Exit-Entry Administration of the Public Security Bureau</strong>
          in the district where you lived or registered your residence in Beijing. Some districts accept applications
          through designated police stations or a centralized service center. You can usually find the exact window
          and address on the official website of the local Exit-Entry Administration or by calling their hotline.
        </p>
<h3>Who is generally eligible?</h3>
<p>
          The typical applicants are foreigners who have held valid visas or residence permits and who actually lived
          in Beijing during the period to be covered by the certificate. Whether short-term stay can be covered depends
          on whether there is a record in the public security information system (such as accommodation registration).
        </p>
<h3>What documents are usually required?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Original passport and copies of the information page and Chinese visa / residence permit pages;</li>
<li>Information about your old passport as well, if you have renewed your passport since leaving Beijing;</li>
<li>Proof of residence during your stay in Beijing, such as police accommodation registration forms or residence permits;</li>
<li>If a third party is applying on your behalf, a signed power of attorney and the agent's ID document;</li>
<li>Any additional documents requested by the accepting authority, such as employment or school certificates.</li>
</ul>
<p>
          When contacting the Exit-Entry Administration, it is advisable to first confirm whether an appointment is required,
          what time period can be included on the certificate, and whether applications submitted from overseas or via an
          authorized agent are accepted.
        </p>
<h3>Estimated processing time</h3>
<p>
          Under normal circumstances, it takes roughly <strong>several working days to two weeks</strong>
          from formal acceptance to issuance of the Police Certificate.
          Processing times may vary depending on the district in Beijing and the overall workload at the time.
        </p>
<hr class="section-divider"/>
<h2>Step 2: Notarization and further legalization in Beijing</h2>
<h3>Where to notarize the Police Certificate?</h3>
<p>
          If the Police Certificate will be used for immigration, long-term visas, work permits or background checks abroad,
          it usually needs to be notarized by a notary office in Beijing that handles foreign-related cases.
          You can choose a notary office based on your location and convenience; some offices also cooperate with agencies
          that can help you with translation and subsequent authentication.
        </p>
<h3>What documents are commonly required for notarization / legalization?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The original Police Certificate issued by the Public Security Bureau in Beijing;</li>
<li>The applicant's passport and a copy of the information page; if the passport was renewed, old passport details are recommended;</li>
<li>Power of attorney and the agent's ID if you entrust an individual or agency to handle the process;</li>
<li>Information about the destination country, purpose of use (immigration / long-term visa / work permit, etc.) and target language;</li>
<li>Any additional documents required by the notary office or legalization body for the specific country.</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Depending on the destination country, the notarized document may also need to go through
          <strong>Hague apostille</strong> procedures or <strong>consular legalization</strong>.
          Different countries have different chains and time frames. You should confirm the exact process and
          whether translated versions are needed before submitting your application.
        </p>
<h3>How long does notarization / legalization usually take?</h3>
<p>
          As a rough reference, issuing the notarized certificate itself often takes around
          <strong>3–5 working days</strong>. If translation, Hague apostille or consular legalization is required,
          the overall timeline may extend to roughly 1–3 weeks. To avoid affecting your overseas application,
          you should leave sufficient buffer time before any deadline.
        </p>
<hr class="section-divider"/>
<h2>Step 3: Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h2>
<h3>Q1: I left Beijing years ago. Can I still obtain a Police Certificate?</h3>
<p>
          In many cases it is still possible, as long as the public security system retains your records
          of residence and accommodation in Beijing. Whether your case can be accepted and what time period
          can be covered should be confirmed directly with the Exit-Entry Administration in charge.
        </p>
<h3>Q2: My passport has been renewed. Will it affect the application and notarization?</h3>
<p>
          A passport renewal itself normally does not prevent you from obtaining the Police Certificate, but it may add
          some extra steps for matching and verifying your information. It is recommended to provide copies of both the old
          and new passport information pages, and clearly explain the connection between the two passports, so that staff
          can locate your historical records more efficiently in the system.
        </p>
<h3>Q3: Can I entrust a professional agency to handle the whole PCC and notarization process in Beijing?</h3>
<p>
          In most cases, the Police Certificate and notarization procedures in Beijing can be assisted by an authorized
          agency, including preliminary consultation, document sorting, appointment booking, submitting the application,
          following up on the progress and collecting the results. For a few steps (such as video verification or signing
          in person on site), the applicant may still be required to cooperate in person.
